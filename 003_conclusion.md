# Conclusion

The approach to ethnicity and how it was defined by the countries of Imperial Japan, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union were key aspects if not the main motivating factors for the initial invasion and conquest of the Axis powers and the beginning of the Second World War. Both Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany approached ethnicity with the motivating ideal of racial superiority in their respective regions- Japan was motivated by the idea of “pan-Asianism” which was the idea of unifying all Asian peoples to lift them out from Western influence. The Nazis were motivated by the idea of the “Aryan race” and considered themselves to be superior to other peoples. As a result of this superior status because of ethnicity, the Japanese and German armies engaged in brutal violence and committed mass atrocities unlike anything seen before. Based on ethnicity the Japanese Imperial Army felt it was their right to unite Asia under their rule and viewed other Asian peoples as below them. The Nazis felt that their was the only one worth moving forward into the future so this motivated them to unite all Germanic peoples to create a Germanic empire, and to discard those lesser races. The Soviet Union was a massage empire with dozens of different ethnic groups and engaged in mass deportations of ethnic minorities in order to make it more ethnically Russian or Russification. The Soviet Union claimed to promote equality but manipulated ethnicity for political control. Ethnicity was a key component of all three countries with Germany's approach rooted in racial hierarchy, Japan's in cultural superiority, and the USSR’s in political unity. Germany and Japan focused on external aggression- using race and ethnicity as justification for imperial actions while the USSR’s actions often targeted internal populations. All three of these regimes used ethnicity for political, military, or ideological objectives. They implemented policies that led to widespread human rights violations, including ethnic cleansing and forced relocations.
