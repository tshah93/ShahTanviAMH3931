## Japan 
Japan’s aggressive and fascistic actions after World War I laid the groundwork for their imperial ambitions across Asia. From the early 30s to the end of the war, Japan invaded and annexed territories throughout all of Asia, even reaching into US territories and Australia, claiming to be the liberators from the east.[^1] This claim came from the belief that Japan alone was capable of leading Asia, an idea that soon tied itself to their national rhetoric and a key reason for war. This ideology traces back to Pan-Asianism, a 19th-century movement advocating for Asian unity following Western Imperialism. During the Meiji Period. Japan took this idea and co-opted it in order to advocate for their own territorial ambitions.

From this period of political realignment re-emerged the concept of “Yamato Damashii” (Japanese Spirit) which symbolized their national pride.  Loyalty, courage, and honor (found in Shinto beliefs and the Bushido code) were key to this “Japanese Spirit,” and these qualities were tied to Japan, both land and people; an idea that would later be evoked commonly in their propaganda. The quote below was a popular slogan used during the Sino-Japanese War where this “Japanese Spirit” was used as a rallying cry to their civilians:

"Yamato-damashii wa nanigoto mo kanau" (大和魂は何事も叶う)
"With the Japanese spirit, anything can be achieved."

The Meiji government embraced this belief as it fostered Japanese nationalism at home. This ideological drive combined with victories against much larger armies (such as The Qing Dynasty and The USSR) allowed Japan to leverage their place and status in the region, giving them enough reason to invade and dominate Manchuria in spite of Western disapproval. Japanese leadership assumed that due to their military quality, they’d be able to rule Asia in place of the western powers.[^3] Emperor Hirohito in the 30s claimed this himself, justifying the invasion of Manchuria and Indo-China by establishing the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere:

"The purpose of Japan’s advance into Southeast Asia was to secure the resources which Japan needed for self-preservation, as well as to liberate the Asian nations under European rule, so they might stand alongside Japan as members of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere."
