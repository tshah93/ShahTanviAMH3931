# Analysis
## Japan 
Japan’s aggressive and fascistic actions after World War I laid the groundwork for their imperial ambitions across Asia. From the early 30s to the end of the war, Japan invaded and annexed territories throughout all of Asia, even reaching into US territories and Australia, claiming to be the liberators from the east.[^1] This claim came from the belief that Japan alone was capable of leading Asia, an idea that soon tied itself to their national rhetoric and a key reason for war. This ideology traces back to Pan-Asianism, a 19th-century movement advocating for Asian unity following Western Imperialism. During the Meiji Period. Japan took this idea and co-opted it in order to advocate for their own territorial ambitions.

From this period of political realignment re-emerged the concept of “Yamato Damashii” (Japanese Spirit) which symbolized their national pride.  Loyalty, courage, and honor (found in Shinto beliefs and the Bushido code) were key to this “Japanese Spirit,” and these qualities were tied to Japan, both land and people; an idea that would later be evoked commonly in their propaganda.

The quote below was a popular slogan used during the Sino-Japanese War where this “Japanese Spirit” was used as a rallying cry to their civilians:

"Yamato-damashii wa nanigoto mo kanau" (大和魂は何事も叶う)
"With the Japanese spirit, anything can be achieved."

The Meiji government embraced this belief as it fostered Japanese nationalism at home. This ideological drive combined with victories against much larger armies (such as The Qing Dynasty and The USSR) allowed Japan to leverage their place and status in the region, giving them enough reason to invade and dominate Manchuria in spite of Western disapproval. Japanese leadership assumed that due to their military quality, they’d be able to rule Asia in place of the western powers.[^3] Emperor Hirohito in the 30s claimed this himself, justifying the invasion of Manchuria and Indo-China by establishing the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere:

"The purpose of Japan’s advance into Southeast Asia was to secure the resources which Japan needed for self-preservation, as well as to liberate the Asian nations under European rule, so they might stand alongside Japan as members of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere."
Dokuhakuroku (The Emperor’s Monologue)[^4]

The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was a suggested political and economic bloc in Asia united and led by Japan.[^5] Japanese politicians, posters, and literature propagated this idea of a better Asia under Japan. Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, echoed these sentiments domestically and in order to justify their annexations of Korea, China, and others across Asia and the Pacific: 

“The countries of East Asia must be guided to independence and self-sufficiency through a spirit of mutual aid and solidarity, under the leadership of Japan… Japan is tasked with liberating Asia from Western oppression.”
Prime Minister Hideki Tojo

In a realpolitik view, Japan’s economy and industrialization were too reliant on Chinese imports and labor and this dependence created vulnerabilities that Japan sought to address through territorial expansion and resource control, particularly during its imperialist campaigns in the early 20th century. Combining this with the US’s strict embargoes and oil dominance, resulted in policy aiming towards resource independence[^7]. Using false flag operations like The Mukden[^8] and Marco Polo Bridge[^9] incidents, Japan invaded other Asian countries. Japan mobilized their newly mechanized army to make vast land grabs throughout China and Vietnam. They also annexed regions all across mainland and Southeast Asia. 

In the newly annexed territories, Japan had a sustained propaganda effort, where they’d portray themselves as partners rather than rulers and stressed the importance of anti-western unity[^10]. In regions like Manchuria and Burma, the Japanese government would establish puppet states and recruit local soldiers into the army to foster the idea of equality between them. And in places that were previously occupied by the west, Japan would preach anti-colonial ideas. This messaging was effective at first especially in Vietnam, where early-on local would celebrate their new Japanese occupiers[^11]. While these practices somewhat engaged the occupied, the reality of their actions betray their words. 

While Japan claimed these invasions were done to protect Asia’s interests, the realities were far different. Japanese actions across annexed territories were violent, destructive, and intentional. Under them, Asia saw between 10-20 million dead civilians through a combination of direct military action, massacres, starvation, sexual abuse, and forced labor. This analysis will look at their actions in the regions/countries of Manchuria, Vietnam, and The Philippines to show the brutal realities found under Imperial Japan’s rule. 

The most infamous example of Japanese cruelty is the Nanjing Massacre in 1937. It was a six-week-long killing where Japanese soldiers raped, killed, and brutalized the Chinese population[^12]. Survivors who later testified about the atrocity expose Japan’s hypocrisy. Li Xiuying, a survivor who was brutally attacked and later testified about her experience:

"I was stabbed thirty-seven times… It was as if I were dead; they thought I was dead, so they left me there. But I survived. I saw my family members killed, my home destroyed. The horror of that time cannot be described[^13]."

Their behavior didn’t only manifest itself in killings, but sadistic experimentation, with them testing biological weapons on foreign populations, the most infamous group being Unit 731. This Unit would release diseases like the plague, anthrax, and cholera to Chinese civilians in order to make room for Japanese settlers[^14]. Japan’s brutality to other Asians wasn’t limited to China. Throughout the continent, similar incidents of ethnic cleansing and acts of genocide were well documented. In Vietnam, Japan ruthlessly requisitioned food from Northern Vietnam leading to an event called The Great Famine, where an estimated 1-2 million northern Vietnamese starved to death[^15]. In the Philippines, an infamous event known as the Manila Massacre led to an estimated 100,000 dead civilians due to systematic executions by the Japanese occupiers.

And throughout the empire, Japan engaged in abducting women and sexually abusing them. “Ianfu,” roughly translated to “comfort women” was what they called this systemic sex slavery[^17]. The pattern throughout all this is clear: Japan was no liberator and used their advantageous position to rape and plunder Asia on a scale even larger than the west they claimed to free them from. Carlos P. Romulo, a Filipino diplomat of the time who saw the invasion of the Philippines said it best: 

"Japan did not come to liberate; they came to conquer. We saw no liberators, only men who brought with them violence and tyranny in their wake[^18]."

As Japan’s war efforts intensified, specifically after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, their view of racial supremacy began to change as mounting defeats from the American forces came. Japanese propaganda initially labeled the United States as weak and apathetic, one weakened by multiculturalism. They often made fun of the “The American Melting Pot” in propaganda, criticizing the United States’s diverse population. 

{% assign media = site.media_metadata | where_exp: "item", "item.name == 'demons'" %} {% include media.html pages=media %}[^19]

As the war progressed (specifically after The Battle of Midway in 1942), Japanese concepts towards race began to change. As the tide of war quickly went in favor of the US as they held naval, air, and land superiority exposed the inadequacy of Japan’s propaganda about American weaknesses. Even Emperor Hirohito expressed fear as the Americans began their Island Hopping campaign:

“Our enemies, though weakened, still have the strength to strike back. Our position has become more perilous. We must take all necessary measures to ensure the defense of our homeland[^20].”

The American military’s resilience and technological superiority challenged the ideas of Japanese supremacy that their government instilled upon the civilians. Japan suffered setback after setback: firebombings, destroyed infrastructure, culminating in the nuking of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki, destroying any pre-conceived notions about Japanese superiority. The irony of them being defeated by the epitome of a multicultural nation was not lost on them either. As the war ended and their leaders were executed (Hirohito wasn’t but renounced his divine status), Japan was forced to demilitarize and allow the US to democratize them. 

Ultimately the rise and fall of Japanese racial superiority during World War 2 allows us to study how race, ideology, and expansion all mixed together. Japan claimed to be the leader of Asia and free the East from western colonizers, yet their behaviors resulted in the deaths of millions of civilians, horrible abuses of sex, and the vile treatment of prisoners. They claimed that the US was weak due to its multicultural population, yet this same multicultural group was responsible for their total surrender. In this case-study of Japan, we see clearly how Japan’s ambitions were clear and violent, yet wildly different from their government’s messaging. In the next segment, we will discuss how ethnicity played a role in The USSR. 

## USSR



## Germany
### Ideology on Racial and Ethnic Issues
The basic ideology on racial and ethnic issues in Nazi Germany pointed to the fact that they believed that Jews were an inferior race. This way of thinking is known as Antisemitism. Adolf Hitler embraced Antisemitism in his baseline thoughts, feelings, and actions. Actions executed in Nazi Germany include the boycotting of Jewish-owned businesses, the Nuremberg Race Laws, and the Civil Service Act are a direct result of how Hitler viewed the Jewish Race and convinced his citizens to act towards Jewish people. 
Hitler coined a term which is the “un-people” referring to how he thinks the Jewish people are a parasitic race and are not a real race of people. In 1935 the Nuremberg Race Laws were passed, this law stripped German Jews of their citizenship and declared them as “subjects” of the state. The Nuremberg Race Laws were divided into 2 Laws related to race. These laws were the Reich Citizenship Law and the Law for Protection of German Blood and German Honor. The Reich Citizenship Law is what stripped German Jews of their citizenship, their right to vote and participation in politics. The German Blood and German Honor Law guarded against relations between citizens of German Blood and Jewish persons because the Nazis didn’t want mixed race offspring.
