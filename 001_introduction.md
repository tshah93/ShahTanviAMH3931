# Introduction
 Comparative ethnicity is the broad study of comparing different ethnic groups across many locations. Throughout history governments have exploited ethnic groups to legitimize their agendas and show acts of aggression. In the context of WWII, ethnicity was a major theme throughout as it related to the ethnic cleansing of Jewish people in Germany, the USSR and their nationalistic ideals, and in Japan’s fight against Western Imperialism. In this paper we analyze how the governments in Japan, Germany, and the USSR portrayed themselves to the world as saviors while they invaded and utilized violence to harm other nations. More specifically, the Japanese government claimed to be a liberator of Asia from Western powers however, their military expansion into China and Southeast Asia proved to have severe consequences. Similarly, in Germany the government framed itself as a protector of the “Aryan race” in order to invade other Eastern European countries. In the USSR, the government preached socialism and advocating for the working class as a reason to invade neighboring countries. The analysis will show how governments claimed they were saviors to justify invasions but the reality was harsh violence.
